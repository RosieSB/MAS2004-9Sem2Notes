    "In the same setting as Definition~[2](#def:functionlimit), we say that a function $f:X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ *diverges* at $x=a$ if $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist. There are some interesting types of behaviour involved here. For example, we say that the function $f$ *diverges to infinity* at $x = a$ and we write $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a} f(x) = \\infty$ if for every sequence $(x_{n})$, with $x_{n} \\in X$, $x_n\\neq a$, which satisfies \\$ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} x_{n} = a\\$, we have $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} f(x_{n}) = \\infty$, i.e. the sequence of real numbers $(f(x_{n}))$ diverges to infinity. The notion of *divergence to minus infinity* is defined similarly, and in that case we write $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a} f(x) = -\\infty$. For an example of divergence to infinity, consider e.g. $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{1}{x^2}$. The details are left to you.\n",
