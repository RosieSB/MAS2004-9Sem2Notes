    "## 0.1. Module structure and overview\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes, and the accompanying lectures, cover material relating to SoMaS modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAS2004 Analysis and Algebra.** 20 credit module; year-long.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes cover the Semester 1 part of the module, which is the analysis part. In Semester 2, you will be focussing on algebra topics with a different lecturer.\n",
    "- **MAS2009 Analysis.** 10 credit module; Semester 1 only. It is precisely the first semester of MAS2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both modules have 22 lectures and 5 tutorials in Semester 1. There are two lectures each week, with the exception of reading week (Week 7). Tutorials are in Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9 and 11, and the particular time and location will depend on your tutorial group allocation. I will also hold office hours twice per week, which you can use as drop-in sessions for help with anything you are finding difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1.1. Module overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This semester, we will pick up where you left off in MAS107 last year, and look at some classical analysis topics. The main themes will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Continuity.* <br> What does it mean to say that a function is continuous? What is the \"right\" definition, that will give us the theorems we want and and enable us to prove them rigorously?\n",
    "- *Differentiability.* <br> What is the \"right\" definition of differentiability, and how is it related to that of continuity? We'll prove some beautiful theorems that connect the formal definition for the derivative to geometric properties of curves. %We'll also see how differentiability can be used to approximate functions by polynomials, using Taylor's theorem.\n",
    "- *Sequences and series of functions.* <br> In MAS107, you studied sequences and series of real numbers. In Chapter 4, we focus on sequences and series in which each term is a function, rather than a number. This allows us to rigorously define important functions such as the exponential function, in terms of a uniformly convergent power series.\n",
    "- *Integration.* <br> We give a formal treatment of the Riemann integral, in terms of areas under curves. We'll prove some more famous theorems, such as the fundamental theorem of calculus, which allows us to view integration as the opposite of differentiation.\n",

    "This is a very readable and engaging book that aims to make learning analysis accessible for students are still meeting it for the first time.

    "A sequence being convergent means its terms are getting \"closer and closer\" to its limit $l$. Being Cauchy says that the terms are getting \"closer and closer\" to one another. In fact, being convergent is strictly stronger than being Cauchy: if $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$ and $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $A$, then\n",

Then, *viewed as a sequence in* $A$, $(x_n)$ does not converge. However, if we instead view it as a sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$, we know that $x_n\\rightarrow 0$ as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$.

    "\n",
    "Analysis, like all areas of pure mathematics, is interested in proving things carefully and rigorously. This requires technical arguments, and in order to communicate unambiguously, we will need to use formal language such as quantifiers.\n",

    "There are two important quantifiers used by mathematicians:\n",

    "#### Negation\n",
    "\n",
    "The *negation* of a mathematical statement is its logical opposite. When negating statements involving quantifiers, the roles of $\\forall$ and $\\exists$ trade places, while all other parts of the statement are replaced with their logical opposites.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the definition of disjoint sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A, B\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}\t \\; \\text{ are disjoint \\; iff }\\;\\; \\forall x\\in A, \\; x\\notin B.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, $x_n\\not\\rightarrow l$ if and only if there is some $\\varepsilon>0$ for which, no matter how large we choose $N$, there is an even larger $n$ for which $|x_n-l|\\geq\\varepsilon$. You can think of this as \"$|x_n-l|\\geq\\varepsilon$ infinitely often\".\n",

    "### 2.3. Inequalities\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed by now that analysis often involves proving that things are less than epsilon. For this reason, inequalities often feature.\n",

    "\n",
